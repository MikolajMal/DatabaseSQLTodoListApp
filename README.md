This repository contains a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application. The application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern and integrates with a local MySQL database. The main purpose of the application is to demonstrate my skills in developing desktop applications, implementing MVVM, and working with databases.

## Features

- **MVVM Architecture**: The project is structured following the MVVM architectural pattern, which promotes a clear separation of concerns between the UI, application logic, and data.
- **MySQL Integration**: The application communicates with a local MySQL database to perform INSERT and DELETE operations on data related to the portfolio items.
- **Insert and Delete**: Through a button click, you can add new todo items to the database and remove existing ones.
- **Sorting Functionality** (Planned): I am currently working on adding sorting functionality to the application, allowing users to arrange todo items based on specific criteria.

## Technology Stack

- **C#**: The primary programming language used for the WPF application.
- **WPF**: Windows Presentation Foundation provides the framework for building the user interface and interactions.
- **MVVM**: Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern for maintaining a clean separation between UI and business logic.
- **MySQL**: Local MySQL database used for storing todo items data.
- **XAML**: Extensible Application Markup Language is used for designing the UI.
- **Visual Studio**: The IDE used for developing and debugging the application.

Feel free to explore the code and UI design to understand how the MVVM pattern is implemented and how the application communicates with the MySQL database.
